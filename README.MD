### Welcome to the **Metrics and Models** homepage!

Hi! We are a group of health and social data scientists located at the Demographic Science Unit within the University of Oxford ([Charlie](http://crahal.com/), [Jiani](https://vallerrr.github.io/), [Claire](https://duiyidai.github.io/), and [Daniel](https://github.com/dhvalden)). This is a website dedicated to a new online, open seminar series which we're launching.

<center> <span style="color:red;">Note: This seminar series is in the `pre-launch` phase while we try to co-ordinate some of our first speakers!</span> </center>

<br>


**Frequency**: First Wednesday of every month, starting May 2025.

**Focus**: We have a focus on health and social data science.  We're specifically interested in predictive methods. We're also interested in the mathematical philosophy underpinning prediction, and efforts to make research more reproducible in general.

**Open to Everyone!** Importantly, this seminar series is open to *everyone*. We've tried to schedule it at a time of day that's amenable to people in the US, Europe, and China all the same.

**Time and Place**: The seminar series will be held online at 1pm UK time (GMT and BST).

**Registration**: To register, send a blank email or otherwise to metrics_and_models-subscribe@maillist.ox.ac.uk.
